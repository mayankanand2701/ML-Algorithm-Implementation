# ML-Algorithm-Implementation
This repository contains implementations of various Machine Learning algorithms from scratch using Python. The goal is to build a strong foundation by implementing algorithms step by step without relying on pre-built ML libraries.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for validation only)

## How to Use:
Clone the repo and explore the Jupyter notebooks for each algorithm. Contributions are welcome! ðŸš€
